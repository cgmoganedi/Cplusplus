Other OpenMP directives
Nested pragmas are also used when a section within a parallel block must be
executed in a special way, such as when a section must be executed in
sequential order among the threads (the ordered pragma), when a section
must be executed only on the master thread (the master pragma), when a
section must be executed atomically (the atomic pragma), when a section should only be executed in one thread (the single pragma), when a section
should only be executed by the master (the master directive) or a critical
section, which can only be executed by one thread at a time (the atomic
pragma).
OpenMP synchronization
OpenMP offers the following basic parallel synchronization operations. Some
of these are specified by the programmer using OpenMP pragmas embedded
in parallel regions while others are specified using OpenMP function calls.
