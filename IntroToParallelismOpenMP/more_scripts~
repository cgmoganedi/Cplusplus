Other OpenMP directives
Nested pragmas are also used when a section within a parallel block must be
executed in a special way, such as when a section must be executed in
sequential order among the threads (the ordered pragma), when a section
must be executed only on the master thread (the master pragma), when a
section must be executed atomically (the atomic pragma), when a section should only be executed in one thread (the single pragma), when a section
should only be executed by the master (the master directive) or a critical
section, which can only be executed by one thread at a time (the atomic
pragma).
