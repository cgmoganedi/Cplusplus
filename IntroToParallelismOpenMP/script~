	-Scope-
By default, variables declared outside the parallel region and used within the parallel region are SHARED.

This means:
	a) within the parallel region, the variable will inherit its initial state from its state in the master thread just prior to the parallel region,
	b) any state changes inside the parallel region are visible in all threads, and
	c) after the parallel region, its value in the master thread will reflect the most recent write among all the threads.
	
The programmer should use thread synchronization when writing shared variables that are read in another thread.

Alternatively, the programmer can mark an externally declared variable as being private in the parallel region using the “private” directive option. In C++, the programmer can achieve the same effect by declaring the variable inside the parallel region.

Private variables are local to each thread, such that changes to the variable
are only visible to the thread making the change and the variable state is
destroyed when the thread is destroyed.
